    <h1>Doctor Prompter Privacy Policy for Alexa Skills</h1>
    <hr><br>

    <p>
        This privacy policy describes how Doctor Prompter (“Doctor Prompter”, “us” or “we”) protects your (“you”,
        “the user”) privacy and your data. Before using our Alexa Skill (“our skill”), please read this policy and the
        Alexa Terms of Use and the Privacy Policies by the Amazon
        Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”).
        <br><br>
        Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skill)
        and other related Software.
        <br><br>
        If you use our skill you fully agree to this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        We never collect or share personal data with our skill.

        To improve our services we analyze automatically how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is
        done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.

        For our skill it is necessary to save data for you in our databases. This data is only connected to
        your Alexa-UserId but never to your name or any other personal information. In the case of our skill we save
        which questions and how many you answered correctly. Otherwise we could not provide you this service.

    </p>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
        When you use our skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and us where we use it to
        understand what our skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an
        appropriate answer.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
        Our skill or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You
        can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your
        continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your
        acceptance of both.
